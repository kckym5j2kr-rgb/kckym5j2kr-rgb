# Hi there! 
#Claudia here, tuning in from Spain 🇪🇸
#I write about behavioral science and policy analysis, turning complex ideas into clear, engaging stories that anyone can learn from and use 🧠✨

#In my free time, I build side projects that pop into my head—small tools and experiments designed to make everyday life a bit easier and smarter 🛠️💡
#If you’re curious about behavior, public policy, or just love exchanging ideas, let’s connect and share knowledge! 🤝📚
